# Boolean simplification of the cell definition. Options are

# It has been observed that in general the smallest decomposition is obtained decomposing first with largest group of parallel plane, 
# but when the number of parallel plane in a group is very large it is better to decompose first with the group a smaller parallel planes
# The code will decompose first with the largest group of parallel planes unless the number of planes in this group is highest than the
